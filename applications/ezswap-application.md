## Project Overview
EZswap is the first community-centered NFT Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
Our goal is to simplify NFT trading by improving liquidity and sharing profits with the community.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** EZswap, a NFT DEX protocol
- **Brief Description:** EZswap is a NFT DEX protocol using AMM model 
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the EOS Network or Antelope software.
- **Reason for Interest:** An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

EZswap is a platform for users to trade NFT with AMM model, and we also provide custom NFT launchpad, Web2 auth wallet and on-ramp solutions helping projects to gain more users and liquidity. The key formula for our AMM model is x\*y=k. 
We've already provided swap pool, which allows users to create liquidity pool for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs, with a factory contract on ETH mainnet and poligon.

### Ecosystem Fit

EOS aims to attract more web3 users by games and NFT, and EZswap is hereby benefiting games with our protocol and excellent team insights, helping them build native NFT DEX to save cost and time. It is very crucial for EOS early projects, and it can lower the barrier of game and NFT.
Our protocol target users are games, artists and relevant business partners are our target audiences. The Gaming (GameFi) market cap of May in 2023 is $10.1 Billion, meaning that these games volume can be ourpotential growth market. 
As for other competitors such as sudoswap and hadeswap, they are more likely to attract users directly rather than 2B side. However, we are trying to attract the 2B side and accumulate the users by protocol.
As we know, every game needs a native NFT trading platform to conpensate that they may lose royalty by other platforms. Hence, they would like to charge users by themselves rather than leaving users to others. 
And our protocol helps games build their own NFT trading platform very easily and it is better for the fungible NFT (gaming assets) liquidity, beneficil for the pricing and liquidation. It is also good for projects to manage the NFT liquidity by AMM rather than order book.
Currently, there are no similar projects in EOS and related ecosystems. We are the first one and the only one who provides NFT DEX protocol toward games and other parties. And there are some similar projects which focus on C2C NFT sales by NFT DEX, however, they don’t have any protocol or ideas about B2B side.
