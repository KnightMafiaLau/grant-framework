## Project Overview
EZswap is the first community-centered NFT Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
Our goal is to simplify NFT trading by improving liquidity and sharing profits with the community.

### Overview


- **Name:** EZswap, an NFT DEX protocol
- **Brief Description:** EZswap is a NFT DEX protocol using AMM model 
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** Referred by EOS Team, expanding our protocol through EOS EVM to help more NFT and Gamefi project build a sustainable ecosystem. 
- **Reason for Interest:** Expanding to more gaming system.

### Project Details

EZswap presents a groundbreaking protocol allowing users to trade NFTs through the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. We further provide a customizable NFT launchpad, a Web2 auth wallet, and on-ramp solutions designed to bolster project growth by enhancing user engagement and liquidity. GameFi platforms can capitalize on the EZswap protocol to develop an on-chain NFT trading marketplace. This approach not only incentivizes users to supply liquidity for their NFTs, but also offers them the opportunity to partake in protocol fees and in-game tokens, thereby strengthening a more resilient gaming ecosystem.

Presently, the vast majority of GameFi projects rely on the order book model for NFT trading. This model, unfortunately, often falls short in terms of efficiency and fails to enhance the gaming ecosystem holistically. Within the context of the EVM ecosystem, sudoswap has been a pioneer in integrating NFTs with the AMM model. However, sudoswap primarily functions as a third-party marketplace and falls short of offering in-game integration.

EZswap is dedicated to empowering GameFi projects, providing them with extensive optimization including a launchpad, staking features, and token emission based on liquidity. These features aim to assist GameFi projects in harnessing greater value from their player base, onboarding next billions of users to web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

EOS aims to attract more web3 users by games and NFT, and EZswap is hereby benefiting games with our protocol and excellent team insights, helping them build native NFT DEX to save cost and time. It is very crucial for EOS early projects, and it can lower the barrier of game and NFT.
Our protocol target users are games, artists and relevant business partners are our target audiences. The Gaming (GameFi) market cap of May in 2023 is $10.1 Billion, meaning that these games volume can be ourpotential growth market. 
As for other competitors such as sudoswap and hadeswap, they are more likely to attract users directly rather than 2B side. However, we are trying to attract the 2B side and accumulate the users by protocol.
As we know, every game needs a native NFT trading platform to conpensate that they may lose royalty by other platforms. Hence, they would like to charge users by themselves rather than leaving users to others. 
And our protocol helps games build their own NFT trading platform very easily and it is better for the fungible NFT (gaming assets) liquidity, beneficil for the pricing and liquidation. It is also good for projects to manage the NFT liquidity by AMM rather than order book.
Currently, there are no similar projects in EOS and related ecosystems. We are the first one and the only one who provides NFT DEX protocol toward games and other parties. And there are some similar projects which focus on C2C NFT sales by NFT DEX, however, they don’t have any protocol or ideas about B2B side.

## Development Roadmap

Q1 2023: 
API & EVM
Product 3.0 (Gamefi & Mint Pool): In this stage, GameFi projects will have the ability to utilize the protocol to establish an on-chain NFT marketplace. This will enable users to supply liquidity and generate income from protocol fees associated with the buying or selling of NFTs.
Marketing (Focus on Customer side & Gamefi): conduct "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) sessions with holders of blue-chip assets and GameFi projects. This effort is intended to broaden our reach within the NFT community. A testament to our expanding influence will be the attainment of 20,000 followers on Twitter and a thriving Discord channel with over 10,000 members.

Q2 2023: 
EVM
Product 4.0：aiming to introduce the integration of a Web2 Auth Wallet and establish on-ramp and off-ramp features. This development will streamline the onboarding process for Web2 users in GameFi projects. Additionally, we plan to enhance our protocol, enabling users to earn token emissions from projects when they provide liquidity on our protocol.
Listing (Depending on environment) & Marketing: onboarding 2 Gamefi projects as pilot test for our protocol, gaining TVL > 100ETH

Q3 2023: 
Investment team & Ecosystem
